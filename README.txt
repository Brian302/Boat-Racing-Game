Some characters may not be visible or displayed correctly when viewed in Eclipse (they somehow work everywhere except Eclipse). To mitigate this, please either run "Compile and Run.bat" or "run JAR.bat" manually in "Assignment\src\" to launch the game.

Batch files in src folder:
"Compile and Run.bat": compiles the class file and create a jar file, then run the program.
"run JAR.bat": runs the previously compiled jar file.
